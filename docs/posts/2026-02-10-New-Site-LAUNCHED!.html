                    <p>Hey there! If you're reading this, it means <b>my new portfolio site</b>--as well as my new blog area(!!!) are now up! ...it definitely took me longer than expected (the blog portion took <i>days</i> to try and work out w/ my formatting. It should not have taken that long lmao)</p>
					<p>If you're new, then hello! I'm Amber McPherson--a pixel artist and animator going nearly 8 years strong as of this post. If you're an employer, or are just interested in what I do, please direct yourself to my <a href="../portfolio.html">portfolio section</a> and then consider shooting me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:brawlersinzone@gmail.com">brawlersinzone@gmail.com</a>. Please note this e-mail is for work purposes only!
                    <p>For those curious, I've dabbled in HTML before--I even helped redesign the homepage for <a href="https://www.indiepogo.com/">Indie Pogo</a> back in the day. I knew I always wanted to have my own little personalized website, especially given the necessity to have an area to show my artwork for potential hires. It's only until recently when I buckled up and did some digging into hosting my own website. As it turns out, it's actually not that difficult? Wack.</p>
					<p>I'm hoping I can use this space more often to show new projects and art I've been working on as they release! Who knows--I may even provide some insight into my work as a pixel artist. We shall see! For now, feel free to bookmark this page and stick around! I'm sure there's new stuff just around the corner....</p>
